Welcome to Mythic Battles: Ragnarok.

Enter the battlegrounds of ancient norse mythology, pitting your Divinity's army against another.

In Mythic Battles: Ragnarök, Skirmish Mode provides a direct and tactical gameplay experience focused on combat and strategic unit management. Here's an overview of the basic rules, starting with the win conditions:

## How to Win
殺了對方的神或泰坦（神性持有者） 
Defeat a Divinity: The game ends immediately if you manage to slay an opponent's divinity (either a God or Titan).  
吸收神性石：吸收總共四塊神性石也是一個獲勝條件  
Absorb Divine Stones: Alternatively, you win if your divinity absorbs a total of four divine stones.

## Game Setup
1. 挑選一個戰場  
Choose a Board: Agree on a game board to use.  
2. 挑選首家：丟骰子，數字高先行動  
Determine Lead Player: Each player rolls a die; the highest roll chooses who begins.  
3. 雇用你的軍隊：使用ＲＰ（雇用點數）來雇用，玩家輪流進行雇用，包含神，英雄，怪物和軍隊。  
依照玩家人數，每人持有不同的ＲＰ，兩人遊戲時，每人為 18 點。  
Recruit Your Army: Using Recruitment Points (RP), players draft their army, including gods, heroes, monsters, and troops, based on the number of players:
2 players: 18 RP each.  
4. 設置戰場，BGA會幫你設好，就是把遊戲物件放上圖版  (依據選擇的戰場)  
Set Up the Battlefield (In BGA Battlefields are set up for you): miniatures, divine stones, and any other game components are arranged according to the selected board/battleground.

3. 回合結束：決定使用另一張戰爭藝術卡來啟動另一個單位或執行軍隊回召。
